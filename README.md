# Face-Recognition-Using-PCA-and-Euclidean-Classifier
In this repo, I will using Principal Component Analysis and Euclidean Classifier for face recognition with GUI. Principal component analysis (PCA) is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables (entities each of which takes on various numerical values) into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components. To clasify the image, I use euclidean classifier. The Euclidean classifier is also known as the Euclidean distance classifier. This classifier is used to measure the distance between a set of samples in the N-dimensional feature space.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

- To use this demo
> 1. Clone this repository
> 2. Change directory to the folder where the file is located
> 3. Run guiPCA.m 

- Step use the GUI
> 1. Run program
> 2. Select image that want to recognize using"browse" button
> 3. Click "Recognize" button to recognize face that you chose
> 4. Click "reset" button to reset all of the image and edit text
> 5. Click "exit" button to close the GUI and program
